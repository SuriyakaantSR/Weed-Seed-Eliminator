Already existed in sensor 

Hyperspectral Imaging: reflect or absorb light.
Infrared Sensors:detect differences in heat emitted by different types of plants or soil.

Ultrasonic Sensors:surface or detect obstacles

Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR):detect buried objects, including roots and possibly weed seeds

Electromagnetic Sensors: indicate the presence of different materials, including organic matter from weeds.

Optical Sensors:analyze the light reflected from the soil and plants. They can be used to detect variations in plant color and health

Spectral Reflectance:This method involves measuring the spectral reflectance of plants and soil. Different types of vegetation, including weeds, reflect light differently, allowing for their identification through spectral analysis.

Soil Moisture Sensors:While not directly used to detect weeds, soil moisture sensors can help monitor soil conditions. Weeds often have different water requirements than crops, so changes in soil moisture might indirectly indicate weed presence.
